# w-certificate-v4

The Certificate component is rendered as a link which opens a WordProof certificate modal.
The modal is also triggered by adding `#wordproof` hash tag to the url of the page that contains it.

```html
<w-certificate-v4></w-certificate-v4>
```

<w-certificate-v4 v-pre style="margin-top: 2rem; display: block;"></w-certificate-v4>
